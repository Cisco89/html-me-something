						I am a jack of all traits yet master of none. As I grow as a person I realize that I very
						much like to continue learning new things. At this moment I am working on learning as much
						as I can about web development from this class. While attending this class I have also found 
						I do not have as much free time as I expected. 
						<br/>
						<br/>
						I happen to have realized that I delve in many things. Wether is codding, sports, or just social life. 
						Learning where to allocate your time can be difficult but very rewarding when done correctly. Mistakes 
						will happen and there will be moments that can be felt as a waste of time. It is difficult to change 
						one's own perspective, yet I belive it is imperative that one must move past and accept the time spent 
						learn from it. Learning what is a true waste of time can help identify when to avoid it in the future.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						Surpicingly, this part of the asssignemnt has been the most difficult. Since I care very little about 
						writing or in this case typing multiple paragraphs of text. I debbated for some time as to what I might 
						be able to find to just copy and paste here. However, after sufficient time I had to just vomit words 
						into the file to just have to display. I am not particularly proud of this, but such is life and the 
						assignement required this. I am unsure how much of this will be read and I apologize for my gramatical 
						errors since writing was never a strong suit of mine.
